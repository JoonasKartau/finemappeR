Description: This package contain functions for running FINEMAP-MISS, 
  a Bayesian variable selection method for genetic fine-mapping. 
  This method is an extention of FINEMAP (Benner et al. 2016). 
  FINEMAP-MISS differs from previous methods, as it allows for the combination 
  of multiple datasets across biobanks, while also functioning with missing data.
